# FancyCars.ca

FancyCars is a full stack SPA. Front end was developed using React/Redux. It was initialized using `create-React-app` and then ejected for custom webpack configs. The back end was developed using node + express and was initialized using `express-generator`. This app was coded on a mac and tested in Chrome. It has not been tested on Windows. Production mode is not yet supported.

## To setup, build and run:

1.  Clone repo
2.  `yarn` or `npm install`
3.  `yarn setup` or `npm run setup`
4.  `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
5.  That command should open the app to `localhost:3000` and it should look like the following screenshot
